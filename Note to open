open two separate Anaconda Prompt terminals.

Terminal 1 will run your Backend (the AI and database server).

Terminal 2 will run your Frontend (the React website).

Part 1: Start the Backend Server (Terminal 1)
Open your first Anaconda Prompt.

Navigate to your project folder on the D: drive:

Bash

D:
cd plant_project
Activate your Conda environment:

Bash

conda activate plant_project
Run the Flask application (app.py):

Bash

python app.py
Wait. This will take a minute to load all the AI models into memory.

Success Check: The server is running when you see these lines at the bottom: * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0) * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

Leave this terminal open and running. You can minimize it.

Part 2: Start the Frontend App (Terminal 2)
Open a second, new Anaconda Prompt.

Navigate to your frontend folder (which is inside the plant_project folder):

Bash

D:
cd plant_project\frontend
Activate your Conda environment (this is good practice to keep the node/npm versions consistent):

Bash

conda activate plant_project
Run the React app's start script:

Bash

npm start
Wait. This will compile the React code.

Success Check: This will automatically open a new tab in your web browser pointing to http://localhost:3000.

Once both parts are running, your application is fully online. The website at http://localhost:3000 can now communicate with your AI server at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
